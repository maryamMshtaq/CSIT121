	   <h2> What is XML? </h2>

	       <p>  XML stands for extensible markup language. It consists of a set of codes, or tags, that are not predefined. XML describes the text in a digital document and how it is shared or transported over the internet. The primary function of XML is to show what's in a document and how the stored data or information is structured. XML organises information in a way that is very easy to read and understand. XML tags are known as ellements. The first element is known as the "root element," the second element as the "child of the root element," the child of the product node is in the middle, and the last element is the child of the root element.</p>
